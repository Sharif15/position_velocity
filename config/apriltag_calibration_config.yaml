# AprilTag Calibration Configuration File
# This file contains all configurable parameters for the AprilTag calibration process

# AprilTag Settings
apriltag:
  target_id: 0              # ID of the AprilTag to use as origin reference
  size: 0.15                 # Physical size of the tag in meters
  family: "tag36h11"        # Tag family (tag36h11, tag25h9, tag16h5, tagCircle21h7, tagStandard41h12)

# File Paths
paths:
  # Path to camera intrinsics YAML file
  # Use absolute path or relative to package share directory
  intrinsics: "intrinsics.yaml"
  
  # Path where extrinsics will be saved
  # Use absolute path or relative to package share directory  
  extrinsics: "extrinsics.yaml"

# Camera Settings
camera:
  topic: "/image_raw/compressed"    # ROS topic for camera images
  target_width: 1920                 # Target width for image processing (reduces computation)
  target_height: 1080                # Target height for image processing
  process_every_n_frames: 2         # Process every N frames (1=every frame, 2=every other frame, etc.)

# Detection Parameters
detection:
  # AprilTag detector settings
  border: 1                         # Tag border width in pixels
  nthreads: 1                       # Number of threads for detection
  quad_decimate: 2.0                # Decimate input image by this factor
  quad_blur: 0.0                    # Apply low-pass blur to input image
  refine_edges: true                # Spend more time trying to align edges
  refine_decode: false              # Spend more time trying to decode tags
  refine_pose: false                # Spend more time trying to precisely localize tags
  debug: false                      # Enable debug output
  quad_contours: true               # Use quad contours
  
  # Stability requirements for auto-save
  required_stable_detections: 5     # Number of consecutive stable detections required
  stability_window_seconds: 2.0     # Time window for considering detections as stable

# Image Preprocessing
preprocessing:
  enable_blur: true                 # Enable Gaussian blur preprocessing
  gaussian_blur_kernel: 3           # Kernel size for Gaussian blur (must be odd number)

# Example configurations for different scenarios:

# For high-precision applications:
# detection:
#   required_stable_detections: 10
#   stability_window_seconds: 3.0
#   refine_edges: true
#   refine_decode: true

# For faster processing:
# camera:
#   process_every_n_frames: 3
# detection:
#   quad_decimate: 3.0
#   required_stable_detections: 3

# For different tag families:
# apriltag:
#   family: "tag25h9"     # Smaller tags, less robust but faster
#   family: "tag16h5"     # Even smaller, fastest detection
#   family: "tagStandard41h12"  # Larger tags, more robust but slower

# Common tag sizes (in meters):
# - Small desktop tags: 0.05 - 0.1
# - Medium tags: 0.1 - 0.2  
# - Large wall-mounted tags: 0.2 - 0.5

# - Compressed images: "/image_raw/compressed"
# - Uncompressed images: "/image_raw"
